The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed 
six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at 
a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Based on this datasets, we created a tidy datasets that contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for 
each subject and each activity.After that, we estimated mean and standard deviation based on subject and activity group in the tidy dataset.

Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below.

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING


The tidy data contains 6 rows (averaged based on activity) and 68 columns (66 variables and activity labels).
